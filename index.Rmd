# Repguide <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The Repguide R package is a _beta_ development version to facilitate the design of guideRNAs for CRISPR/dCas9 targeting of repetitive DNA sequences, such as those derived from transposable elements. 

### Functionality

The basic workflow consists of exploring and selecting target sites, computing the guideRNA universe, and finding the optimal combination of guides that maximizes target-specific coverage.
 
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/schematic.png')
```

#### Features include:
 * Multi-species support
 * Flexible genome annotation
 * Black- and whitelisting
 * Multiple sequence alignment
 * Promoter identification
 * Consensus positional targeting
 * Genome-wide mapping
 * On and off-target scoring
 * Combinatorial optimization (multiple guides)
 * High-quality reports
 
More details on the usage of Repguide is available in the package [vignette](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/Repguide/articles/Repguide.html). 

### Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager (in case you haven't already)
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install Repguide
install.packages('Repguide', repos = 'tanaylab.bitbucket.io/repo')
```

**Note**: Repguide requires R version 3.5 or higher. The package was tested on linux and macbook machines, but is currently not compatible on Windows. A typical application will require at least 4 GB RAM, but heavier use cases (e.g. large guideRNA universe) may require 8 GB RAM or more. For improved speed performance, we recommend a multi-CPU/core workstation.
