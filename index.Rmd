# Repguide <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The Repguide R package is a pre-alpha development version to facilitate the design of guideRNAs for CRISPR/dCas9 targeting of repetitive DNA sequences, such as those derived from transposable elements. 

#### Functionality

The basic workflow consists of exploring and selecting target sites, computing the guideRNA universe, and finding an optimal combination of guides to maximize scoring. More details on the usage of Repguide is available in the package [vignette](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/Repguide/articles/Repguide.html). 
 
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/schematic.png')
```

#### Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager, devtools, and tgstat (in case you haven't already)
install.packages('BiocManager')
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('tgstat', repos=c(getOption('repos'), 'https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/repo'))

# Install Repguide
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"), BiocManager::repositories()))
devtools::install_bitbucket('tanaylab/repguide', ref='default')
```

**Note**: Repguide currently requires Unix environment. In particular it uses the Tanay group tgstat library that utilizes shared memory and distributed computing (as well as some specific optional CPU features).
