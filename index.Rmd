# Repguide <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The Repguide R package is a _beta_ development version to facilitate the design of guideRNAs for CRISPR/dCas9 targeting of repetitive DNA sequences, such as those derived from transposable elements. 

### Functionality

The basic workflow consists of exploring and selecting target sites, computing the guideRNA universe, and finding the optimal combination of guides that maximizes user-defined scoring:
 
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/schematic.png')
```

#### Features include:
 * Multi-species support
 * Flexible genome annotation
 * Black- and whitelisting
 * Multiple sequence alignment
 * Promoter identification
 * Consensus targeting
 * Genomic mapping
 * On and off-target scoring
 * Combinatorial optimization for multiple guides
 * Quality control reports
 
More details on the usage of Repguide is available in the package [vignette](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/Repguide/articles/Repguide.html). 

### Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager, devtools, and tgstat (in case you haven't already)
install.packages('BiocManager')
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('tgstat', repos=c(getOption('repos'), 'https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/repo'))

# Install Repguide
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"), BiocManager::repositories()))
devtools::install_bitbucket('tanaylab/repguide', ref='default')
```

**Note**: Repguide currently requires Unix environment. In particular it uses the Tanay group tgstat library that utilizes shared memory and distributed computing (as well as some specific optional CPU features).
