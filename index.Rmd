# Repguide <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The Repguide R package is a _beta_ development version to facilitate the design of guideRNAs for CRISPR/dCas9 targeting of repetitive DNA sequences, such as those derived from transposable elements. 

### Functionality

The basic workflow consists of exploring and selecting target sites, computing the guideRNA universe, and finding the optimal combination of guides that maximizes target-specific coverage.
 
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/schematic.png')
```

#### Features include:
 * Multi-species support
 * Flexible genome annotation
 * Black- and whitelisting
 * Multiple sequence alignment
 * Promoter identification
 * Consensus positional targeting
 * Genome-wide mapping
 * On and off-target scoring
 * Combinatorial optimization (multiple guides)
 * High-quality reports
 
More details on the usage of Repguide is available in the package [vignette](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/Repguide/articles/Repguide.html). 

### Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager, devtools, and tgstat (in case you haven't already)
install.packages('BiocManager')
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('tgstat', repos=c(getOption('repos'), 'https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/repo'))

# Install Repguide
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"), BiocManager::repositories()))
devtools::install_bitbucket('tanaylab/repguide', ref='default')
```

**Note**: Repguide is implemented in R and currently depends on the Tanay group tgstat library that utilizes shared memory and distributed computing (as well as some specific optional CPU features). The package is tested on linux and should run on macbooks (Windows is currently not supported). A typical application will require at least 4GB RAM, but heavier usecases (e.g. large guideRNA universe) may require 8 GB RAM or more. For improved speed performance, we recommend a multi-CPU/core workstation.
